For example: Those ribbons added to the top-left of Video Episodes&rsquo; thumbnails in their Listing Pages aren&rsquo;t needed for the Listing Pages of any Section under the <em>Perim</em> menu, so we won&rsquo;t load the instructions for these ribbons to work anymore. The same way, <em>Disciplinary</em> and <em>Elemental Affinity</em> Icons aren&rsquo;t needed for any of the Video Pages, so they won&rsquo;t be loaded there either.</p></li></ul><h6 id=public-content-related-changes-1>Public Content-related changes</h6><ul><li><p>Adjusted all Cards Search Tool&rsquo;s Data Parsers to the fix applied to the HTML structure of Card Types Partial Templates (see below)</p></li><li><p>Updated Changelog Page</p></li></ul><h6 id=css-related-changes>CSS-related changes</h6><ul><li><p>Improved the vertical alignment of Navigation Menu&rsquo;s visibility toggle button on mobile devices</p></li><li><p>Reduced the <code>height</code> of Thumbnail Images on mobile devices</p></li></ul><h4 id=fixed>Fixed</h4><h6 id=hugo-templates-related-changes-2>Hugo Templates-related changes</h6><ul><li>Fixed the HTML structure of the Partial Templates for <em>Creatures</em>, <em>Locations</em> and <em>Mugics</em> to use the HTML attribute <em>class</em> instead of <em>id</em> because even though with the Content Files Componentization the componentizable Articles will indeed have only one <em>id</em> their main Articles will have more than one, thus resulting not only in semantically invalid HTML markup but also interfering with Cards Search Tool&rsquo;s functionality</li></ul><h6 id=public-content-related-changes-2>Public Content-related changes</h6><ul><li>Fixed an issue with Cards Search Tool Parsers for <em>Attacks</em>, <em>Battlegears</em> and <em>&ldquo;All&rdquo;</em> that were looking for the Card <code>rarity</code> without specifying that only the first occurrence should be used</li></ul><h6 id=css-related-changes-1>CSS-related changes</h6><ul><li>Fixed an issue caused by the horizontal fix implemented in the previous revision that was preventing the Sidebar Advertisement to follow the Main Content.
