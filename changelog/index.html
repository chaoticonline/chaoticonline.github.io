<h4 id="added">Added</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>After a revision made to the FrontMatter Parameters infrastructure, the Parameters <code>listed</code> and <code>comentable</code> which, respectively, prevents an Article to be listed and allows it to be discussed through Facebook Comments Plugin, have been added, both set as <code>false</code>, in all published componentizable Articles of Locations variants</p></li>

<li><p>After a revision made to the FrontMatter Parameters infrastructure, all Pages related to a top-level in Navigation Menu (i.e. <em>Perim</em>) received in their <code>_index.&lt;LANG&gt;.md</code> files a new Parameter named <code>category</code></p></li>

<li><p>After a revision made to the FrontMatter Parameters infrastructure, all Pages related to a sub-level in the Navigation Menu (i.e. <em>Attacks</em>) received in their <code>/&lt;SUBFOLDER&gt;/_index.&lt;LANG&gt;.md</code> files a new Parameter named <code>category</code>, overwriting their parent&rsquo;s -AND- an additional Parameter named <code>subcategory</code> with the same effect of the now removed <code>group</code></p></li>

<li><p>After a revision made to the FrontMatter Parameters infrastructure, all Pages related to either a top-level or a sub-level in the Navigation Menu received in their <code>_index.&lt;LANG&gt;.md</code> files the following Parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>commentable</code>, defining whether or not the Listing Page can be discussed through Facebook Comments Plugin</li>
<li><code>analytics</code>, defining whether or not the Listing Page will receive Google Analytics <em>data-mining</em></li>
<li><code>advertisable</code>, defining whether or not the Listing Page will receive Advertisements, on the sidebar and among the results (visible only on mobile versions)
Theoretically, these Parameters should be added only in the topmost level Pages (i.e. <code>/perim/_index.&lt;LANG&gt;.md</code>). but their availability through Hugo&rsquo;s <code>.Params</code> is too strict, with Pages under a sectioned Parent having their Parameters available through <code>.CurrentSection.Params</code> instead. This complicates the Template Development as we have to constantly switch between these aliases</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Added two i18n entries to distinguish the <em>Follow</em> from the <em>Share</em> intentions in the revamped implementation of <em>Social Links</em> Template</p></li>

<li><p>Added a new Partial Template for Schema.org&rsquo;s <em>SiteNavigationElement</em> to be rendered together in main the <em>SEO</em> Partial</p></li>

<li><p>Added a new Partial Template for Schema.org&rsquo;s <em>BreadcrumbList</em> to be rendered together in main the <em>SEO</em> Partial</p></li>

<li><p>Added an instruction in the <code>config.yaml</code> file to automatically remove accents from paths, which allowed a massive reduction in the revamped implementation of SEO for <em>Videos</em> as we don&rsquo;t need to remove them by hand anymore</p></li>

<li><p>Added an i18n identifier for <em>Terms of Use</em>, allowing the SEO Partial Template for <em>Article</em> to find a match for that Page as well</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<li><p>With a revision made to the FrontMatter Parameters infrastructure, all occurrences of Parameter <code>section</code> have been removed as its old functionality is handled by the <code>category</code> Parameter</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed Hugo&rsquo;s <code>errorf</code> from the <em>Perim</em> Partial Template as it&rsquo;s not needed anymore</p></li>

<li><p>Removed HTML markup for <em>OpenLoad</em> and <em>TheVid</em> from <em>Videos</em> Single Page Template as they&rsquo;re not needed anymore</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-2">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Renamed i18n identifier <code>title-card-search</code> to <code>title-section-card-search</code>, allowing the SEO Partial Template for <em>Article</em> to find a match for the Cards&rsquo; Search Tool as well</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-2">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Revamped implementation of the <em>Social Links</em> Template</p></li>

<li><p>With a revision made to the FrontMatter Parameters infrastructure, both <em>Listing</em> and <em>Single</em> Pages Templates have been updated to reflect the changes in their Section Headers</p></li>

<li><p>Simplified the way the revamped SEO implementation is included in the Header Partial Template</p></li>

<li><p>With a revision made to the FrontMatter Parameters infrastructure, the HTML markup of Standalone Pages has been simplified. The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags has its HTML attribute ID set with Pages&rsquo; <code>category</code> and the <code>subcategory</code>, if defined, is appended its list of classes.</p></li>

<li><p>With the simplification, if Standalone Pages&rsquo; HTML markup, the <em>Perim</em> Partial Template used only for Cards&rsquo; Articles has also been simplified by removing the redundant Taxonomy Term <code>type</code> from the list of classes wrapping the Content</p></li>

<li><p>Moved the <em>Page X of Y</em> provided by Hugo&rsquo;s <code>Paginator</code> from <em>Header</em> Partial Template to <em>Schema.org&rsquo;s Title</em> Partial Template</p></li>

<li><p>Simplified (A LOT) the <em>Schema.org&rsquo;s Title</em> Partial Template, but, most important, we made the <em>Title</em> built GLOBAL, by defining it under the scope of passed along by the Partials since the Header Template. This way we can keep everything grouped in one place and, at the same time, use this value to define the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag</p></li>

<li><p>Updated <em>Schema.org&rsquo;s BlogPosting</em> (a.k.a Articles) Partial Template to reflect the changes made with the revised FrontMatter Parameters infrastructure and the change of scope of the <em>Title</em> (see above)</p></li>

<li><p>Moved Twitter OpenGraph Tags from <em>Header</em> Partial Template moving to the main <em>SEO</em> Partial Template</p></li>

<li><p>Moved Yandex Authorization Code up the code along with Facebook&rsquo;s, this way it also respects GDPR -AND- Pages restrictions configured by the FrontMatter Parameter <code>analytics</code></p></li>

<li><p>Moved OpenGraph Properties <code>fb:pages</code> and <code>fb:profile_id</code>from inner SEO Partials to the <em>Common Opengraph</em> Partial</p></li>

<li><p>With Schema.org&rsquo;s <em>BreadcrumbList</em> in its own Partial Template, the <em>Breadcrumbs</em> Partial Template has been edited to use the structured provided by the SEO Implementation</p></li>

<li><p>Universalized the usage of <code>$this</code> while referencing to <code>.this</code> in (almost) all componentizable Partial Templates for SEO, in order to not cause confusion in the future</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the default value of the Property <code>description</code> for Schema.org&rsquo;s <em>BlogPosting</em> and <em>Videos</em> (a.k.a <em>TVEpisode</em>). Now, if there&rsquo;s no <em>Summary</em> defined, the <em>Page Title</em> will be used instead of the <em>Site Name</em>. This prevents N &ldquo;unpublished&rdquo; Pages (in the concept of having an actual Article or not) to have the same Description</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-1">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added a reduced version of Cards&rsquo; Search Page intro as its summary, this way the SEO implementation has something better to work with</p></li>

<li><p>With the renaming of the i18n identifier for Cards&rsquo; Search Tool (see above), all occurrences of it have been replaced throughout the site</p></li>

<li><p>Updated Changelog Page</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Improved the vertical alignment of little arrows near Navigation Menu entries indicating they have sub-menus</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed a typo in a word that slipped through FOUR grammar auto-checkers O_O (English only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed, with a palliative solution, an issue with Hugo&rsquo;s Minifier not properly removing comments in one of the componentizable JS files, thus resulting in syntax errors because of unexpected tokens</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-3">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed an issue with SEO Partial Template for <em>Listings</em> that were using a non-existent i18n identifier when building the <code>headline</code></p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue with the value of Schema.org&rsquo;s <code>inLanguage</code> property which had both components of the Language Code separated by an underlines while the right would be a hyphen</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue with the new componentizable SEO Partial for <em>Webpage</em> in which because a missing value for the <code>isPartOf</code> property, after adding the new componentizable Partial for <em>Breadcrumbs</em> a wrong relation was being created</p></li>

This way we ensure that all Pages, even those not effectively published yet due lack of real content has a value for the tag</p></li>

<li><p>Added Bing&rsquo;s Authorization XML file so it can properly crawl the site because, apparently, Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t know understand that, as of today, quotes around the HTML attributes of these tags and/or ending slash for self-closed tags are optional</p></li>

<li><p>Modified the <em>Include</em> Shortcode to not ask for a file if the request format is Git Hash, &ldquo;throwing an error&rdquo; if GIT HEAD doesn&rsquo;t exist because the repository is corrupted or there&rsquo;s no repository at all.

<h4 id="added">Added</h4>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added a second &ldquo;in-ads&rdquo; advertisement block in the published Article about <em>Najarin</em> since it is very long and thus comport without forcing too much</p></li>

<li><p>Published the Episode #21, Season #01 with Brazilian Portuguese audio</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>With the revamp in the way CSS and JS files are included (see below), all files under <code>/themes/chaotic/src</code> have been moved to <code>/assets</code>, Hugo&rsquo;s default directory for compiled Resources, which, by all means, represents files removal and the inclusion of a new ones</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Changed the way the CSS stylesheet files are loaded by making use of the <em>Critical Path</em> methodology, loading all styles needed after everything in the Page had been rendered, making the loading time faster from the second visit and onwards — when the browser the resource already cached — at expense of having elements blinking or even entirely unstyled (slow connections) until the page finished loading</p></li>

<li><p>Revamped the way CSS and JS files are included by expanding the functionality of the FrontMatter Parameter <code>include</code> currently in use only by Cards search Tool.
With this important change, not only we already have a small performance improvement by not having one of the Family Fonts used exclusively by Cards Search Tool loaded everywhere, but in the future releases, this will allow us to fragment the CSS file currently in use, and thus loading only what&rsquo;s really essential to each Page.
For example: Those ribbons added to the top-left of Video Episodes&rsquo; thumbnails in their Listing Pages aren&rsquo;t needed for the Listing Pages of any Section under the <em>Perim</em> menu, so we won&rsquo;t load the instructions for these ribbons to work anymore. The same way, <em>Disciplinary</em> and <em>Elemental Affinity</em> Icons aren&rsquo;t needed for any of the Video Pages, so they won&rsquo;t be loaded there either.</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-1">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-2">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Fixed the HTML structure of the Partial Templates for <em>Creatures</em>, <em>Locations</em> and <em>Mugics</em> to use the HTML attribute <em>class</em> instead of <em>id</em> because even though with the Content Files Componentization the componentizable Articles will indeed have only one <em>id</em> their main Articles will have more than one, thus resulting not only in semantically invalid HTML markup but also interfering with Cards Search Tool&rsquo;s functionality</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-2">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with Cards Search Tool Parsers for <em>Attacks</em>, <em>Battlegears</em> and <em>&ldquo;All&rdquo;</em> that were looking for the Card <code>rarity</code> without specifying that only the first occurrence should be used</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-1">CSS-related changes</h6>

<li><p>Removed some duplicated rules in the Card Type / Tribe colouring section of the CSS file</p></li>

<li><p>With the horizontal scroll fix, a few other rules previously added to squeeze more visible space have been removed because they were causing a negative impact</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Modified the Card Information Template to show the Information Box regardless the existence of the custom-made Card in the defined path. If the Card doesn&rsquo;t exist, a default Card inspired in the back side of the original Chaotic Cards will be added as a placeholder</p></li>

<li><p>Adjusted the Bootstrap Grid classes for <em>Creatures</em> so those with <code>Super Rare</code> and <code>Ultra Rare</code> <em>Rarity</em> won&rsquo;t break into two lines in English and languages with similar word lengths</p></li>

<li><p>Improved the horizontal alignment of the Card Images relatively to their the Information Box</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-2">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Improved the positioning of the Big Picture of <em>Carnival of Confusion</em> on big viewports</p></li>

<li><p>The paragraph under the <em>The Animation</em> section of the published Article about <em>Lava Pond</em> has been updated in order to be more on par with the writings of the Article about <em>Magmon</em> published in this revision</p></li>

<li><p>Updated Changelog Page</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-2">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>With the inclusion of the new Elemental Affinity Icons for <em>Tribeless</em> Creatures, the overall format of the CSS Sprites image file changed, with some icons repositioned and, therefore, all <code>background-position</code> and some <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> rules have been updated</p></li>

<li><p>Improved the horizontal alignment of the Big Pictures, mostly noticeable on smaller viewports</p></li>

<li><p>With the fix with <em>Location</em> Cards dimensions (see below) -AND- with the improvements made to the Card Information Template (see above), their Image Credits&rsquo; texts had to be slightly adjusted as well</p></li>

<li><p>Increased significantly the dimensions of <em>Locations</em> Cards</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with the i18n entry about <em>Mount Pillar Reservoir</em> in which, because its identification key lacked the expression <code>-reservoir</code>, its value was overwriting the entry immediately before about <em>Mount Pillar</em> (Brazilian Portuguese only)</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-3">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a misinformation in the componentizable published Article about <em>Najarin, Younger</em> since three Creatures with the same name, regardless of their variant, cannot coexist in the same squad.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-3">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a horizontal scroll on mobile version caused by the our reduction on Bootstrap&rsquo;s default margins at the cost of having slightly larger margins around the main content, thus reducing the visible area</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue with <em>Location</em> Cards getting super small on mobile because of the new dimensioning units implemented in the previous revision</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue with the colouring of Quotes Authors&rsquo; Links (<em>Flavour Texts</em>) of <em>Locations</em> Pages (and, if not fixed, <em>M&rsquo;arrillian&rsquo;s</em> and <em>Tribeless&rsquo;</em> as well) in which, because of a wrongly defined declaration for Links and Italic-styles for <em>Danians</em>, everything else below it would get the brownish colour defined for them (Danians), instead of their own colours (respectively, green; dark bluish-green; and grey)</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="image-related-changes">Image-related changes</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Added placeholder Cards, in both landscape and portrait orientations, inspired in the back side of the original Chaotic Cards as counterpart of the change made to the Template Files for <em>Creatures</em> and <em>Locations</em></p></li>

<li><p>Added a Card Image for <em>Rath&rsquo;tab</em>, mostly as a demo of the <em>M&rsquo;arrillian</em> Card Template</p></li>

<li><p>Added a Card Image for <em>Ursis</em>, mostly as a demo of the <em>Tribeless</em> Card Template created</p></li>

<li><p>Because the Card Template for <em>Tribeless</em> Creatures didn&rsquo;t exist before, there were no Creatures&rsquo; Elemental Affinity Icons with their colour scheme (greyish). Now that the Card Template does exist, these icons became available and thus have been added to the remodelled UI CSS Sprites image file</p></li>

<li><p>While restructuring the CSS Sprites image file, the logo of the Video Providers have been removed from the Cards&rsquo; Icons file to be grouped in one of their own as they are never used together, which will slightly improve the loading time of Episodes&rsquo; Pages</p></li>

<li><p>Added the Big Picture of <em>Whepcrack</em> for the new Content Files added as reference for the Article about <em>Magmon</em> published in this revision</p></li>

<li><p>Updated the following Big Pictures with versions of better quality: Allmageddon, Hail Storm, Lavalanche and Megaroar (Attacks), Aquashield, Cyclance, Flux Bauble, Ice Cloak, Liquilizer, Mowercycle, Pyroblaster, Ring of Na&rsquo;arin, Riverland Star, Skeleton Steed and, as a special partially redone work, the Stone Mail (Battlegears)</p></li>

<li><p>Updated ALL pre-existing <em>Creature</em> Cards to align the <em>Creature Type</em> text (Hero, Warrior, Scout&hellip;) with the <em>Card Description</em> -AND- to publish them as <em>Optimized</em> JPEG files, instead of <em>Progressive</em></p></li>

<li><p>Updated ALL pre-existing <em>Location</em> Cards to increase the height of the green band with the <em>Card Type</em> (fixed), to better align any icons among their <em>Descriptions</em> -AND- to publish them as <em>Optimized</em> JPEG files, instead of <em>Progressive</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="miscellaneous-changes">Miscellaneous changes</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Created a new Card Template for <em>Tribeless</em> Creatures</p></li>

<li><p>Updated Sitemap files for <em>Attacks</em>, <em>Battlegears</em>, <em>Creatures</em> and <em>Index</em></p></li>

<li><p>Updated minified CSS</p></li>

<li><p>Added Content Files, <em>Data Files</em> and i18n entries for the following Pages as counterpart of the many changes made in the componentizable Article about <em>Najarin, Fluidmorphers&rsquo; Foe</em>: Heptagon Hail (Attack), Rao&rsquo;Pa Sahkk Chimegrid (Location), Dissonance of Distraction, Requiem of Lost Minds and Requiem of Fear (Mugics) and Mipedian Balladeers&rsquo; Flute (Battlegear)</p></li>

<li><p>Added Content Files, <em>Data Files</em> and i18n entries for the following Pages as counterpart of the many changes made in the componentizable Article about <em>Najarin, High Muge of the Lake</em>: Glacial Balls (Attack), Fluid Fugue (Mugic), Arrthoa, Enre-hep, Kopond and Lore (Creatures)</p></li>

</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Added conditional statements to the Header Partial Template and each of the Cards Types META Tags Partial Templates to include the <code>description</code> and <code>og:description</code> tags to componentizable Articles that usually don&rsquo;t have a <em>Summary</em> defined</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added the Brazilian Voice Actor <strong>Mauro Castro</strong> as the voice of the right head of <em>Cerbie</em></p></li>

<li><p>Added Brazilian Portuguese Voice Actors <strong>Dado Monteiro</strong>, in Episode #11, Season #01; and <strong>Ivo Roberto</strong>, Episodes #03 and #17, Season #01, for <em>H&rsquo;earring</em>, even if they still require more thorough confirmation</p></li>

<li><p>Because the &ldquo;official&rdquo; (it still has some uncertainty u.u&rsquo;) Brazilian Voice Actor for <em>H&rsquo;earring</em> <strong>Ivo Roberto</strong> wasn&rsquo;t associated to other Creature(s) yet, a new i18n entry for his profile in <a href="https://www.myanimelist.com">MyAnimeList</a> has been added</p></li>

<li><p>Published Article about <em>Wamma</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="removed">Removed</h4>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed some unnecessary rules regarding Cards&rsquo; Images shadowing, merging it directly with those of the <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> tag</p></li>

<li><p>Removed unnecessary characters from <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags definitions</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-1">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed <em>M&rsquo;arrillians</em> as enemies of <em>Maxxor</em> from his <em>Data File</em>, after all, the first appearance of Maxxor didn&rsquo;t have any contact with the M&rsquo;arrillians yet</p></li>

<li><p>Removed <em>Xerium Armor</em> as Favourite Battlegear of <em>Maxxor</em> from his <em>Data File</em>, after all, he started using this Battlegear only from the <em>M&rsquo;arrillian Invasion</em> and onwards</p></li>

<li><p>Removed the Brazilian Voice Actor <strong>Luiz Antonio Lobue</strong> as the voice of <em>Magmon</em> in Episode #18, Season #01 because the only instance in which Magmon speaks in that Episode is distorted to represent Maxxor&rsquo;s fear</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Removed A LOT of sizing declarations of Creatures&rsquo; elemental affinity icons, grouping all of them in one single definition</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-1">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>With HTTP tunnelling used to debug the result of the OpenGraph&rsquo;s tags implementation, Hugo Server&rsquo;s start-up command-line became too long, so we added a Windows Batch file that needed to be ignored in <code>.gitignore</code></p></li>

<li><p>Added the <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code> special markup to the published componentizable Articles about <em>Bodal, Flamedrill Researcher</em> and <em>Takinom, the Shadowknight</em> without which the visually hidden text of their Cards were being added as value for the <em>description</em> <code>&lt;meta/&gt;</code> tag</p></li>

<li><p>Changed i18n entries of the Brazilian Portuguese URLs of the componentized Articles about <em>Bodal, Flamedrill Researcher</em> and <em>Takinom, the Shadowknight</em> to follow the naming structure of the mains versions (i.e. prefixing them with <code>/pt</code>). While this change might not seem much for Creatures with their unique names, this reduces the chances of conflicts for other Card Types, especially in other languages</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-2">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Made the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag holding an observation about a Voice Actor a block level element making the text breaking into a new line allowing a few more characters to bet written if needed</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-2">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Returned the keywords to the published Article about <em>Bodal</em> that were wrongly moved to the componentized Article his variant, <em>Bodal, Flamedrill Researcher</em></p></li>

<li><p>Renamed the Brazilian Portuguese version of <em>Xerium Armor</em> to <em>Armadura</em> <strong><em>de</em></strong> <em>Xerium</em>. Even though the Card name of this Battlegear doesn&rsquo;t denote that the armor actually belonged to a Creature called <em>Xerium</em>, it sounds more lexically correct</p></li>

<li><p>With the change above, all occurrences of the old name has been update throughout the site</p></li>

<li><p>Renamed the Brazilian Portuguese translation of <em>Tune of Xerium</em> that appeared only in Episode #19, Season #02, to <strong><em>Melodia</em></strong> <em>de Xerium</em>, as it sounds better than the literal translation of <em>tune</em></p></li>

<li><p>Renamed the Brazilian Portuguese translation of <em>Tune Around</em> that appeared only the last aired Episode to <strong><em>Melodia</em></strong> <em>da Virada</em>, as it sounds better than the literal translation of <em>tune</em></p></li>

<li><p>Renamed the Brazilian Portuguese translation of the now fixed <em>Tune of Turmoil</em> to <strong><em>Melodia</em></strong> <em>do Tumulto</em>, as it sounds better than the literal translation of <em>tune</em></p></li>

<li><p>Translated the Brazilian Portuguese version of <em>Xerium Armor</em></p></li>

<li><p>With the inclusion of the Brazilian Voice Actors for <em>H&rsquo;earring</em>, his <em>Data File</em> has been updated</p></li>

<li><p>With the new Brazilian Portuguese translation of <em>Tune Around</em>, the published Article about <em>Heptadd</em> of the same language has been adjusted to reflect the change</p></li>

<li><p>With the new name given to <em>Wamma, Hive Ordnance</em>, the corresponding keyword in Episode #11, Season #03 has been adjusted (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>Updated Changelog Page</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-1">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Changed root&rsquo;s <code>font-size</code> units from <code>rem</code> to <code>vh</code> allowing the text to scale even if zooming in/out or if OS has a DPI higher than 100%, which is common with big screen monitors</p></li>

<li><p>Parallel to the change above, the images next to big chunks of text also needs to be rescaled and, to achieve that, the measuring unit of them has been changed from <strong>percentage</strong> to <code>vw</code>, the counterpart of the <code>vh</code> unit applied in the change above.
With this, not only (some) images will scale better with the text but also will drastically reduce the blurriness of texts on them, like Cards&rsquo; description</p></li>

<li><p>Parallel to the change above, the measuring units of Creatures&rsquo; Disciplines and Elemental affinities sprite icons have been changed from <code>px</code> to <code>vh</code>/<code>vw</code></p></li>

<li><p>Improved vertical alignment of Creatures&rsquo; Discipline sprite icons</p></li>

<li><p>Improved the positioning of Images Credits&rsquo; texts, especially on mobile versions</p></li>

<li><p>Improved the legibility of Links and Italic-styled texts with the main body of Danians, since the old colour wasn&rsquo;t very distinguishable</p></li>

<li><p>Reduced the size of Creatures&rsquo; Elemental affinity icons, increasing their sharpness</p></li>

<li><p>Adjusted Quotes&rsquo; Authors positioning</p></li>

<li><p>Additionally to making the <code>&lt;span/&gt;</code> tag holding Voice Actors notes a block element (see above), the font size has been reduced and the text colour smoothed, showing slightly less importance if compared to the Voice Actors&rsquo; names</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-2">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a typo in one of the URLs in the published componentizable Article about <em>Lava Pond, Milla&rsquo;iin&rsquo;s Foothold</em> pointing to a non-existent Page while referring to the <em>Riverlands&rsquo;</em> Page (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed some issues with the i18n file for <em>Locations URLs</em> in which, because of a typo in the identifiers of <em>Riverlands, Erak&rsquo;tabb&rsquo;s Foothold</em> and <em>Riverlands, Abandoned Wastes</em>, invalid URLs COULD be rendered. The issue wasn&rsquo;t a real problem because these i18n entries are there more as a commodity since they represent the last, therefore non-anchored, Trail of the Breadcrumbs (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue with the i18n file for <em>Locations Names</em> in which, the because of a typo in the identifier about <em>Kaizeph, City of the Elements</em>, invalid URLs were rendered because the URL identifier, was overwriting this one with the name when dynamically adding anchors to texts (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed Content File about <em>Decomposition</em> (Mugic) whose <em>Data File</em> was wrongly pointing to <em>Canon of Casualty&rsquo;s</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-3">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed an issue with <em>Card</em> Shortcode Partial Template for <em>Locations</em> in which some of the sections in the Bootstrap Grid System used for Cards&rsquo; Information were shorter than others with the same definition, in the same Page, almost like if its width was conditioned to the length of the Cards&rsquo; Names in the first cell-like structure</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue caused, probably, when we reworked the directory structure a few revisions ago, that ended up removing the <em>Summary</em> of all Episodes Pages, leaving the corresponding Heading Titles alone, without content &lt;_&lt;</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue with canonical URL that, locally, if Hugo Server is started bound to a specific domain, it remained set as <code>localhost</code>, preventing OpenGraph debug with HTTP tunnelling that exposes the local server to the Internet</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-3">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed keyword about <em>Tune of Turmoil</em> in Episode #05, Season #02 that was wrongly pluralized</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the <em>Data File</em> about <em>Raimusa</em> whose Big Picture&rsquo;s path was wrongly pointing to <em>Olkiex&rsquo;s</em> and, because we don&rsquo;t have one for him (yet?), Raimusa&rsquo;s images vanished</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed URL entry of <em>Mowercycle</em> in the Brazilian Portuguese Battlegears&rsquo; Sitemap File that was exactly like the English version&rsquo;s</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed i18n entries about <em>Mipedian Cactus</em> and <em>Telebracers</em> URLs that were pointing to non-existent Pages</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-2">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the box with the Voice Actor of a Creature (or with the placeholder text, in case none has been identified yet) that wasn&rsquo;t vertically aligned with the label to its left</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Removed Content Files (and with them, the Pages) about <em>Growlitzer</em> (Battlegear) and <em>Danian Hall</em> (Location) since they&rsquo;re not real Cards and have very little information to even consider becoming an Article</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Officiated the Content File Componentization feature previously implemented as BETA feature only in the published Articles about <em>Takinom</em> and <em>Bodal</em></p></li>

<li><p>Changed URLs of the componentized Articles about <em>Bodal, Flamedrill Researcher</em> and <em>Takinom, the Shadowknight</em> to become a sub-division of their main Cards.

<h6 id="structure-related-changes">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Implemented Content File Componentization in the published Article about <em>Takinom</em> and <em>Bodal</em> as BETA feature using the improved <em>Include</em> Shortcode, putting the subsection about <em>Takinom, The Shadowknight</em> and <em>Bodal, Flamedrill Researcher</em> on its own Page. This way not only main Articles will be shorter after the live testing period but all Cards&rsquo; variations will appear in a Cards Search results because every one of them will have their own URL</p></li>

<li><p>Added an optional FrontMatter Parameter <code>listed</code> through which it&rsquo;s possible to remove an Article/Page from Listings without remove it from the site</p></li>

<li><p>Added Content Files about <em>Takinom, the Shadowknight</em> and <em>Plasmarrow</em>, as counterpart of the many changes made in the published Article about <em>Takinom</em></p></li>

</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<li><p>Added list of Episodes in which <em>Yokkis</em> appeared as well as his Voice Actors in both English and Brazilian Portuguese versions of the site</p></li>

<li><p>Complemented the section <em>Game</em> in the Article about the <em>Glacier Plains</em> referencing the wrongly depicted effects of it seen during the events of Episode #18, Season #01 (<em>Allmageddon</em>)</p></li>

<li><p>Added missing Shortcode markup to allow Cards Search Tool to read the <em>rarity</em> value from the Articles about <em>Mezzmarr</em>, <em>Tangath Toborn</em> and <em>Wamma</em></p></li>

<li><p>Added missing Taxonomy Term <code>type</code> for <em>Song of Futuresight</em> (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>Published Article about <em>Bodal</em></p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="removed">Removed</h4>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-1">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed the FrontMatter Parameters <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> from a few Content Files as these values come automatically from now on (see below)</p></li>

<li><p>Removed all occurrences of attribute <code>class</code> from <em>Cards</em> Shortcode, since it has no effect anymore, from the following published Articles: Maxxor, Najarin, Blazier, Heptadd, Tartarek, Chaor, H&rsquo;earring, Nauthilax, Takinom, Ulmar, Malvadine, Zhade and Lake Ken-I-Po</p></li>

<li><p>Even though the Content File Componentization has been implemented as BETA feature in the publichsed Article about <em>Takinom</em> (and <em>Bodal</em>), all FrontMatter Parameters&rsquo; comments related to the removed Parameters have been removed</p></li>

<li><p>Removed  one of the <em>Deferred Callbacks</em> from the main Cards Search Tool script exclusively to show the Loading Icon after resetting all UI styles as the benefits offered by this approach were minimal</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-1">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Implemented a feature that&rsquo;ll allow Creatures&rsquo; physical traits from FrontMatter Parameters to <code>Data Files</code>, allowing better organization and readability but, most important, the possibility of having Cards&rsquo; Variations&rsquo; Details present structurally in the markup, allowing them to be indexed by Cards Search Tool. For now, it&rsquo;s only implemented in the Articles about <em>Takinom</em> and <em>Bodal</em> as a BETA feature</p></li>

<li><p>Implemented a feature that&rsquo;ll allow the list of Episodes in which a Creature/Location appears from FrontMatter Parameters to <code>Data Files</code>, allowing better organization and readability but, most important, auto-linking. For now, it&rsquo;s only implemented in the Article about <em>Takinom</em> and <em>Bodal</em> as a BETA feature</p></li>

<li><p>Implemented a feature that&rsquo;ll allow identified Voice Actors of at least one of the languages of the site from FrontMatter Parameters to <code>Data Files</code>, allowing better organization and readability. For now, it&rsquo;s only implemented in the Article about <em>Takinom</em> and <em>Bodal</em> as a BETA feature</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Changed the way HTML attributes <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> are added to the <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> tags. Now instead of reading a FrontMatter Parameter, Hugo&rsquo;s Image Metadata Reader function <code>imageConfig</code> is used instead</p></li>

<li><p>Likewise the change above, the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> values defined in JSON+LD Structured Data and <code>&lt;meta/&gt;</code> tags were changed using the same approach described above</p></li>

<li><p>Improved the <em>Include</em> Shortcode that was halted due hard times to find specific information on how to create componentizable Content Files with Hugo</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-2">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Typo, grammar and wording corrections and additions for the following Articles/Pages: Maxxor, Heptadd, Tartarek, H&rsquo;earring, Nauthilax and Takinom</p></li>

<li><p>Renamed the HTML markup of Cards Search Tool to use the Parser name for <em>All Cards</em> as value of the <em>Card Type</em> dropdown</p></li>

<li><p>With the change above, the Tool&rsquo;s main script, <code>Search.js</code>, has been adjusted to only instantiate the parser for <em>All Cards</em> when and if needed, instead of instantiating it by default and then overwrite it with a different one, thus improving performance</p></li>

<li><p>Updated Cards Search Tool to take into account the Content File Componentization implemented as a BETA feature in the Articles about <em>Takinom</em> and <em>Bodal</em></p></li>

<li><p>Improved the Cards Search Tool so now it doesn&rsquo;t need a &ldquo;Swap Area&rdquo; to alphabetically order the results by anymore</p></li>

<li><p>Improved the Cards Search Tool main script to not look for a specific selector multiple times by caching it, thus slightly improving performance</p></li>

<li><p>Improved the Cards Search Tool <em>Filter.js</em> script to not require <code>Filter::filter()</code> to be manually invoked in the main script by wrapping both actions, intersecting and retrieving filtered results, in a new method <code>Filter::getFilteredData()</code></p></li>

<li><p>Improved the Cards Search Tool <em>Filter.js</em> script to ignore punctuation when sorting the filtered ResultSet. With this, Cards like <em>Raznus, Ambassador to the Danians</em> will stay among the other Cards starting with <em>R</em> instead of going to the end of the list</p></li>

<li><p>Modified all <em>Data Parsers</em> of Cards Search Tool so they can prepare the HTML element where the parsed data would go before actually parsing them. This improved the overall performance by removing a condition previously executed within a loop &lt;_&lt;</p></li>

<li><p>Updated Changelog Page</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-2">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an URL duplication issue that was likely the cause of Hugo considering Episodes&rsquo; Listing Pages as Single Pages &ldquo;randomly&rdquo;, always failing in a specific condition</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-2">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an almost unnoticeable an extra space in Site Title</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-3">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a typo in a keyword about <em>Labyrinth of Linsic</em> in Episode #20, Season #01 (English only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the Brazilian Voice Actor of <em>Regginald Terrington</em> (ReggieOne) previously defined as <em>Fábio Lucindo</em> while the correct would be <em>Vagner Fagundes</em>, Voice Actor of, among many other roles, <em>Shikamaru Nara</em> in Naruto, <em>Son Gohan</em> in Dragon Ball Kai and <em>Monkey D. Luffy</em> in One Piece</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed <code>rarity</code> of <em>Skeletal Springs</em>, wrongly defined as <em>Common</em></p></li>

<li><p>Fixed <code>rarity</code> of <em>Ribbian</em>, wrongly defined as <em>Rare</em></p></li>

<li><p>Fixed <code>rarity</code> of <em>Narfall</em>, wrongly defined as <em>Common</em> (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed <code>rarity</code> of <em>Phelphor</em>, wrongly defined as <em>Rare</em></p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the i18n entries about <em>Ørth, the Empowerer</em> and his Content Files to fully describe his name instead of just <em>Ørth</em></p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue with Cards Search Tool that was causing the search results when querying <em>All Cards</em> immediately after searching by a specific <em>Card Type</em>. In this scenario, the first results (by <em>Type</em>) were kept in the dynamically created table and all other results appended to them, messing with the sorting.
Even though this is now fixed, in some locales this may give the impression of not fixed. For example: Most of the times, <em>Aa&rsquo;une</em> is the first Card to be listed because of the two consecutive <em>A</em> in his name, but in <em>Brazilian Portuguese</em> for example, because the article <strong>the</strong> translates into <strong>a</strong>, the space after it in te translated version of Cards like <em>The Passage</em> (both versions) make these two Cards to appear before <em>Aa&rsquo;une</em> instead</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the i18n entry about <em>Mount Pillar</em> URL (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue with Cards Search Tool that was causing occasional duplication of <em>Aa&rsquo;une, the Oligarch</em> -OR- one of the <em>Attack</em> Cards, randomly o.O</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Added a Big Picture for <em>Takinom, the Shadowknight</em> as part of the Content File Componentization implemented in the main Article about <em>Takinom</em> as a BETA feature</p></li>

<li><p>Added the following Big Pictures for the new Content Files added as references for the Article about <em>Bodal</em> published in this revision: Lucky Shot and Viperlash (Attacks), Mount Pillar Reservoir and Gloomuck Swamp (Locations) and Orchis Undis (Battlegear)</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Changed the logic of the Template Files for <em>Creatures</em> and <em>Locations</em> to add the <em>hidden</em> CSS control-class to the Bootstrap&rsquo;s Grid Row where the Card Image would go instead of on each element inside.

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added the possibility of having HTML in <em>Characters&rsquo; Name</em> of Episodes Cast, so it&rsquo;s possible to manually break a name that&rsquo;s too long for the Column to hold it — e.g.: CodeMaster Crellan (Human Form)</p></li>

<li><p>Added a long dash (—) between the element identifying the <em>Season</em> and the <em>Episode Number</em></p></li>

<li><p>Added a missing keyword with <em>Kaz&rsquo;s</em> name ans screen name in <em>Kaz</em> Episode #20, Season #02</p></li>

<li><p>Added the following missing keywords to Episode #17, Season #01: Tharax, Dardemus, Malvadine, Mount Pillar e The Passage (UnderWorld)</p></li>

<li><p>Added Episode #17, Season #01 to <em>Malvadine&rsquo;s</em> list of <em>Appearances</em>, since there&rsquo;s already a published Article about him</p></li>

<li><p>Added <em>Cast</em> up to Episode #17, Season #01</p></li>

<li><p>Published the Episode #17, Season #01 with Brazilian Portuguese audio</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added a complement to the selectors of the Video Pages&rsquo; rules only as consistency to the other rules, since the elements styled there aren&rsquo;t in use in the other Pages</p></li>

<li><p>Added a small top-margin to the blocks related to <em>Videos Details</em> and <em>Observations</em> (in case there&rsquo;s any superscript number) so they get better aligned with the <em>Cast</em> block (if present)</p></li>

<li><p>Added Pagination Links to the list of selectors that <strong>won&rsquo;t</strong> receive the dotted border when hovering the mouse</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="removed">Removed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-1">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Removed, by commenting out, the URLs of the <em>Human Characters</em> in the respective i18n file so entries pointing to Pages that don&rsquo;t exist (yet) won&rsquo;t be added to the Structured Data. The feature remains the same for Creatures</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-2">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Replaced the name <em>Sarah Lawrence</em> with <em>Sarah &ldquo;Beth&rdquo; Cronwell</em> in all Pages, mainly, but not restricted to, keywords because, after recent researches, this proved to be the correct name of her Character</p></li>

<li><p>Expanded all occurrences in all Video Pages&rsquo; Content Files of <em>Kaz&rsquo;s</em> name to <em>Kazdan &ldquo;Kaz&rdquo; Kalinkas</em> <em>Peyton&rsquo;s</em> to <em>Peyton Touhey</em></p></li>

<li><p>Wit the expansion done with <em>Kaz&rsquo;s</em> name, double quotes became part of the name string. Since this information is used mainly to build META Tags Structured Data in JSON+LD, they now reside within their own delimiters which are double quotes as well so, all occurrences, of all Template Files using them, they&rsquo;ve been changed to escape HTML Entities</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the <em>Cast</em> structure allowing a better separation between Human and Creature Characters</p></li>

<li><p>With the change above, the <em>Cast</em> added to Episode #01, Season #01, previously added as a test, had all Characters&rsquo; names reordered</p></li>

<li><p>Updated the comments regarding the FrontMatter Parameter <code>cast</code> in first episode&rsquo;s Content File</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the writing of the i18n entry related to subtitles availability</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the GDPR Cookie&rsquo;s condition in the routine that updates the consent status (by showing/hiding the banner) to use the Cookie&rsquo;s value directly instead of the global variable created in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, making sure the banner would properly hide, which wasn&rsquo;t happening before, in the first time a visitor who hadn&rsquo;t agree/disagree with the Terms of Use yet. That was happening because the routine is executed as soon as the document is ready for manipulation but the global variable is created before that, so when it was trying to read the updated value of the Cookie, set when any of the buttons was clicked, the global variable had already been created with the default zero value as fallback if the Cookie didn&rsquo;t exist yet. And this caused the GDPR banner to never hide, no matter how many time one of the buttons was clicked</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Improved the disposition of the <em>Cast</em> in mobile devices by adding more of the of the Bootstrap Grid Classes</p></li>

<li><p>Even though <em>Facebook Analytics</em> isn&rsquo;t being used anymore, its Template File still exist and the GDPR Cookie condition in it has been simplified</p></li>

<li><p>Changed Videos Pages&rsquo; Section Titles so the <em>Cast</em> is now of fourth-level (<code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>) and <em>Video Details</em> of fifth-level (<code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>), unless there&rsquo;s no <em>Cast</em> defined, case in which it&rsquo;ll remain as fourth-level</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the whole process used to build the Properties <code>actor</code> and <code>character</code> of TVEpisode Structured Data. Now we first read everything available, building an iterable data-structure of our own and then we iterate later over that much cleaner structure to build the Properties. This way we remove many apparently unnecessary conditions and hard-to-read nested blocks</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Updated Changelog Page</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-1">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>With the change in Videos Pages Section Title (see above), the tag which had its font size globally updated in previous revisions (<em>h4</em>) has been changed to <em>h5</em></p></li>

<li><p>With the possibility of having HTML in Characters&rsquo; Names for better disposition of long names, some adjustments had to be made in the HTML markup and this caused the superscript number indicating uncertainty regarding a Voice Actor to be too far from the text. This has been changed by nullifying a Bootstrap&rsquo;s default value</p></li>

<li><p>Because of the same reason described above, a little adjustment had to be made with the dotted border added when hovering links so other elements around the anchor don&rsquo;t &ldquo;jump&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>And since we were updating the <code>&lt;sup&gt;</code> tag globally we took he time to reduce its font size a little bit</p></li>

<li><p>Improved the disposition of the <em>Cast</em> in mobile devices, as counterpart of the changes made in the HTML markup</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-3">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed an issue that was preventing Voice Actors&rsquo; Profile URL list in the <em>Cast</em> to be found when an accentuated vowel was present in the first character of their name/surname since those are usually capitalized and we replace only the lowercase versions of them to simplify the process</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the reason of Pages pointing to <code>/videos/season-X</code> still being generated when they shouldn&rsquo;t since the big restructuring a few revisions ago the URL of each Season has been replaced with their respective names
Until this fix, these Pages weren&rsquo;t publicly available because their files/directories were being manually ignored during the <em>commit</em></p></li>

<li><p>With the fix above the palliative solution that removed them with <code>.gitignore</code> has been removed</p></li>

<li><p>During the restructuring, the <em>Episodes</em> Section was renamed to <em>Videos</em> but, by accessing the respective link from Breadcrumbs Trails, that <strong>did not</strong> point to the expected Page in the same language browsed. This problem, caused by a minor typo i one of the i18n entries with the list of URLs available for template translations, has been fixed (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-2">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a logical issue in <em>Google AdSense&rsquo;s</em> Template File that was preventing all advertising to appear. Prior to this fix, it was tested if the GDPR Cookie <strong>did not</strong> exist and if it didn&rsquo;t exist it was being tested if its value was zero (?), meaning the non-consent with the Terms of Use. Because this obviously would never result in a positive test, the condition always failed and when that happened Google AdSense&rsquo;s mechanism was explicitly configured to not show any advertising</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue that prevented the correct functionality of Social Links, opening the Social Network chosen in popup for the Video and Article Pages</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-1">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed double quote characters used for HTML escaping that remained visible in some of the Images Credits throughout the site because this information didn&rsquo;t have any double quote delimiter, which is the precise reason of having escaping characters (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the <em>Upload Date</em> of the YouTube mirror of Episode #16, Season #01 with Brazilian Portuguese audio</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed a ma-formation with the FrontMatter Parameter <code>mirror</code> in the Episodes #18, #19, #20, #22, #29, #31, #33, #35 and #38, all from Season #01 (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="image-related-changes">Image-related Changes</h4>

<h4 id="added">Added</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Implemented something to cover possible uncertainties regarding Voice Actors with another entry named <code>verified</code> along to the name of each Voice Actor identified listed in the <code>cast</code> FrontMatter Parameter. If this entry is defined for that Voice Actor -AND- set as <code>false</code> a little superscript number is added next to the Voice Actor name</p></li>

<li><p>Added a default value through a recently added i18n entry for cases in which no Voice Actor has been identified for a listed Character</p></li>

<li><p>Added the missing FrontMatter Parameters <code>section</code> and <code>group</code> in the Terms of Use Content File (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>Added a Hugo&rsquo;s Compiler setting to prevent the so-called <em>Fast Render Mode</em> to be used by default. Just a little something to speed-up the server initialization while developing</p></li>

<li><p>Added the FrontMatter Parameter <code>show</code> with the new format of <em>Season</em> and <em>Episode</em> in all applicable Content Files</p></li>

<li><p>Added i18n (internationalization) entries for the newly added Pages: Bierk, Zapetur, Kaal and The Pits</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added missing keywords to the published Article about <em>Lake Ken-I-Po</em></p></li>

<li><p>Added the attacking privilege for the published Article about the <em>Riverlands</em>, in particular regarding the <em>Erak&rsquo;tabb&rsquo;s Foothold</em> version (English only)</p></li>

<li><p>Published Article about the <em>Lava Pond</em></p></li>

<li><p>Added missing keywords about <em>Searing Symphony</em> and <em>Fluid Fugue</em> in Episode #10, Season #03</p></li>

<li><p>Added an additional keyword about <em>Khybon, the Renegade</em> in Episode #13, Season #02</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Added a dotted line while hovering one of the (non-blocked) available languages of the Languages Switcher</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="removed">Removed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-1">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>With the inclusion of the new FrontMatter Parameter <code>show</code> (see above), the entries <code>season</code> and <code>episode</code> (and its sub-entries) have been removed from the FrontMatter Parameter <code>details</code></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Removed a condition that was preventing the second level Section Heading (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) to appear in the Terms of Use Page</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-1">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>With the review of Terms of Use Page (see below), the old <em>Disclaimer</em> Page, which had not much content already, has been removed, along with its related i18n entries and CSS rules</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-1">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed several rules from the Card Types Colours section that were made obsolete with the reviewed link styles</p></li>

<li><p>With the revision of links styles throughout the site (see below), several unnecessary rules have been removed</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-2">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>With the inclusion of the new FrontMatter Parameter <code>show</code> (see above), the JSON+LD used for Videos&rsquo; Structured Data had to been updated pointing to the new entries</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the way the GDPR Cookie is defined with a more commonly used way of defining global variables: adding it to the <code>window</code> Object</p></li>

<li><p>With the change above, the conditions in Google&rsquo;s Analytics&rsquo;, Google&rsquo;s AdSense&rsquo;s and Facebook&rsquo;s SDK&rsquo;s Template Files, as well as GDPR Consent check, became simpler, being the latter also an attempt of preventing the GDPR &ldquo;banner&rdquo; of appearing on mobile devices when the User has already accepted the Terms of Use once</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the name of the GDPR Cookie, forcing a new acceptance of the updated Terms of Use</p></li>

<li><p>With the removal of the <em>Disclaimer</em> Page, the footer has been updated to remove the link to it</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Because of the addition of the <code>verified</code> entry (see above) the superscript <code>1</code> referring to the subtitles availability has been changed to <code>2</code>, except when all Voice Actors are identified with certain, case in which no number <code>1</code> will exist</p></li>

<li><p>Replaced the palliative solution to house the subtitle availability message from an empty <code>&lt;dt&gt;</code> to an additional Bootstrap Grid&rsquo;s Row. Not only it&rsquo;s the correct approach but it&rsquo;s also better to style with CSS</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-2">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added <em>M&rsquo;arrillians</em> as Enemies in the published Article about Takinom</p></li>

<li><p>Updated the comments regarding the FrontMatter Parameter <code>cast</code> in first episode&rsquo;s Content File</p></li>

<li><p>Modified a paragraph in the following published Articles: Maxxor, Najarin, Najarin, Chaor, H&rsquo;earring, Takinom, Glacier Plains, UnderWorld City and Riverlands to make even more evident that what was being said occurred in the Animation</p></li>

<li><p>The attacking privilege paragraph in the published Article about the <em>Crystal Cave</em> has been expanded, making clearer which Creature will attack and what&rsquo;s the effect of the Location itself (English only)</p></li>

<li><p>Minor complement regarding the attacking privilege in the published Artigle about <em>Lake Ken-I-Po</em>, in particular regarding the <em>Ritual Site</em> version (English only)</p></li>

<li><p>Updated the Terms of Use Page with text revision, in order to include the Subsection about <em>Cryptocurrency Mining</em>, format revision to include a ToC Tree, and ortho-grammatical corrections</p></li>

<li><p>Updated Changelog Page</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-2">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Balanced the top margin of all Heading Title tags, adjusting others as necessary — e.g. the one of second level (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>) had its bottom margin reduced in order to not make the one of third level (<code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>) become misaligned</p></li>

<li><p>With the change above, the margins of the horizontal line (<code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>) has been adjusted</p></li>

<li><p>Reduced a little bit the <code>font-size</code> of the fourth level Heading Title (<code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>)</p></li>

<li><p>Reduced even more the opacity of the hovering colour of the Social Links to the left</p></li>

<li><p>Balanced the bottom margin of Definition Lists (<code>&lt;dt&gt;</code>) as well as of Ordered (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>) and Unordered Lists (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>)</p></li>

<li><p>Increased the height of the Language Switcher&rsquo;s little flags by <code>1px</code> adjusting the ration with their width</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the colour of the emphasis tag (<code>&lt;em&gt;</code>) used on Terms of Use Page</p></li>

<li><p>Moved part of the <em>Mipedians&rsquo;</em> Colour Scheme more to the top because it ended up mixing itself up with the <em>Tribeless&rsquo;</em> Colour Scheme added in previous revisions</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="fixed">Fixed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-3">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed the <code>text</code> entry in Pictures&rsquo; <code>credits</code> of several Content Files that wrongly remained in English in the Brazilian Portuguese version of the site</p></li>

<li><p>With the renaming of the i18n entries about Characters as part of the uniformization made in the last revision, one of the entries of the pubslidhed Article about <em>H&rsquo;earring</em> was invalidated and has been fixed now</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-3">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a wrong keyword about the <em>Lava Pond</em> name in Episode #37, Season #01 which wasn&rsquo;t properly translated (Brazilian Português only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed a wrong keyword about the <em>Lava Pond, Milla&rsquo;iin&rsquo;s Foothold</em> in Episode #18, Season #02 because there&rsquo;s no evidence that the Location in which Maxxor battles Ragetrod is indeed the alternate version</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed wrong keywords about <em>Khybon</em> in Episode #16, Season #02 because, from that moment and on, he was under Milla&rsquo;iin&rsquo;s brainwashing and, therefore, the proper variant is <em>Khybon, the Renegade</em></p></li>

<li><p>Fixed a wrong keyword in the published Article about the <em>Riverlands</em>, specifically regarding the <em>Erak&rsquo;tabb&rsquo;s Foothold</em> which wasn&rsquo;t properly translated (Brazilian Português only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed a grammar issue in the published Article about <em>Najarin</em> (English only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed invalid local links (anchors) in the published Articles about Takinom, Maxxor and Chaor reminiscent after the name of the main version of the Creature had been removed from Section Titles — e.g: <em>The Fierce</em> instead of the old way <em>Chaor — The Fierce</em> — a few revisions ago</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the Title of the Videos Page (<code>/videos</code>) that wasn&rsquo;t appearing the Title Bar because its Content File didn&rsquo;t have a <code>Title</code> defined as FrontMatter Parameter</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-3">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed the CSS selector for the wrongly generated empty <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags fix while parsing the Markdown</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed an issue with line-breaks (<code>&lt;br&gt;</code>) when used inside Quote Texts — e.g: Aa&rsquo;une, the Oligarch — that, because of their styles, were causing lines to overlap on mobile devices</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed a weird issue in mobile devices in which after clicking the row of the first result in a Cards&rsquo; Search some semi-random results were appended to the table within the line clicked. The problem has been solved through CSS, by preventing a specific element to be clicked because, maybe, that&rsquo;s a problem with the third-party plugin FooTable used</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed through CSS a weird issue, by preventing elements to be clicked, in which when the first row of a Card Search result is clicked some semi-random results were being created within the first line when viewed on mobile devices</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="image-related-changes">Image-related Changes</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>With the internal structure change (see below), in order to make the <em>Perim</em> Category to work a Page with its own Custom URL had to be added listing all Card Types on it</p></li>

<li><p>And with the change above, an additional Breadcrumb Trail has been added to all Pages under the <em>Perim</em> Category pointing to the new Page created</p></li>

<li><p>Added i18n (internationalization) entries for the newly added <em>Perim</em> Listing Page and for the &ldquo;Share on Facebook/Twitter&rdquo; hover title change (see below)</p></li>

<li><p>Added a Hugo&rsquo;s Compiler setting to prevent automatic pluralization of Section Titles, preventing, for example &ldquo;Perims&rdquo;, even though the corresponding i18n entry isn&rsquo;t pluralized</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>The necessary additions to the Video Template to display the Episode Cast has been created, however, since this still somewhat in BETA stage, it was only implemented in the Episode #01, Season #01</p></li>

<li><p>Added a more friendly hover text of the Social Icons on the left using the recently added i18n entry “Share on Facebook/Twitter”</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added the missing <em>Publishing Date</em> for the following Articles: Tartarek, Ulmar and Riverlands</p></li>

<li><p>Added the recently identified Voice Actors: Intress (Rachael Lillis), Mezzmarr, Tangath Toborn (Dan Green), Khybon (Kevin Kolack), Lord Van Bloot (David Zen Mansley), Magmon (Eric Stuart), Ulmar (Sean Schemmel) and Wamma (Darren Dunstan)</p></li>

<li><p>Added a new i18n file with all URLs of all identified Voice Actors&rsquo; Profiles. With this, not only the other entry <code>link</code> doesn&rsquo;t need to be manually filled anymore (see more below) but also it&rsquo;s not needed to duplicate information in cases in which a Voice Actor portrays multiple characters</p></li>

<li><p>Following the addition above, all Voice Actors&rsquo; Profile URL has been changed in favour of <a href="https://www.myanimelist.com">MyAnimeList.com</a>. Although restrict to Animes and regardless the fact &ldquo;Chaotic&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t appear on the website — since it&rsquo;s not an Anime per-se — it&rsquo;s more appropriate for the context (cartoon) -AND- it offers more complete and organized information about the Characters, the Voice Actors they were portrayed by and different productions the Actor participated in, which is not always possible from IMDB or Wikipedia for example.
However, since not all Voice Actors work with Animes, IMDB and Wikipedia remains as a fallback</p></li>

<li><p>Added missing Advertisement Block in the published Article about Tartarek (English only)</p></li>

<li><p>Added an additional paragraph under the <em>Animation</em> Heading Title in the published Article of about Takinom so the same paragraph on Nauthilax&rsquo;s Article become more precise</p></li>

<li><p>Published the Episode #16, Season #01 with Brazilian Portuguese audio</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added the Tribal Colours for Danians (brown) and Tribeless (light grey) so the Voice Actor box and the URLs of the episodes in which the Creature appear don&rsquo;t get the default colours and/or without background</p></li>

<li><p>Added a subtle grey line between commits in the Changelog Page allowing some sort of distinguishing between them</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="removed">Removed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-1">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li>Since the i18n entry referring to <em>Episodes</em> as a Tilte isn&rsquo;t used anymore (see below) it was removed</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>With the internal structure change (see below) there&rsquo;s no need of a Template File just for the Trivias as this subcategory now shares the same used for the regular Episodes and, therefore, it was removed</p></li>

<li><p>Removed the possibility of having a Creature/Location with &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; rarity in favour of using the Card Shortcode attribute <code>rarity</code></p></li>

<li><p>Removed Facebook Analytics. Not only because resources dependable of Facebook slows down the page load but also because the information provided isn&rsquo;t useful, at least not for now</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-2">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>A heavy change in the internal structure has been made. Now instead of having all <em>Perim&rsquo;s</em> categories of Content Files loose in Hugo&rsquo;s <code>/content</code> root directory, they&rsquo;re now grouped under <code>/perim</code> as it always should be. Not only this is more organized but it also allows Section Pages (a.k.a Listing Pages) to have a Custom URL of their own instead of just an alias</p></li>

<li><p>With the change above, almost all occurrences of Hugo&rsquo;s variable <code>.Section</code> have been replaced by <code>.CurrentSection</code>, which moves the &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; from the beginning of the <em>path</em> to its end</p></li>

<li><p>The FrontMatter Parameters <code>weight</code> and <code>datePublished</code> have been moved closer to the top where they should be as they represent basic information about the Articles/Pages</p></li>

<li><p>Updated the FrontMatter Parameters&rsquo; comments in the English version of Takinom&rsquo;s Article with the changes made in this revision</p></li>

<li><p>With the addition of an i18n file with the Profile URLs of the identified Voice Actors&rsquo;, the way links are associated to the persons are now automatic. As long as the Voice Actor name is correctly spelt, regardless word casing or accented characters (as they&rsquo;re treated automatically) -AND- an i18n entry with this cleansed version of the name can be found, the text will be automatically linked</p></li>

<li><p>Since both <em>Episodes</em> and <em>Trivias</em> are part of the same group now, the i18n entry with the link pointing to the section <em>/episodes</em> has been changed to <code>/videos</code></p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-1">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Grammar correction in the published Article about Tartarek</p></li>

<li><p>Improved Lord Van Bloot&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flavour Text&rdquo; (Brazilian Portuguese only)</p></li>

<li><p>In order to display the recently identified Voice Actors (see above), regardless the publishing state of the Articles, since both Episodes and Voice Actor(s) share the same HTML Template, the list of episodes in which those Creatures appear has been filled</p></li>

<li><p>Improved the paragraph under the <em>Appearances</em> Heading Title, under <em>Animation</em>, not only to simplify the writing but also not to imply that the Creature/Location described in the Article necessarily appear &ldquo;in person&rdquo;, after all, they can simply be visually mentioned as a picture, for example, in the Battleboard without effectively being used in a Chaotic battle</p></li>

<li><p>The video file of Episode #15, Season #01 with Brazilian Portuguese audio has been redone in some parts in order to improve transitions between the remastered, with the dubbed audio and the original audio reused (scenes with only background sounds or just effects, for example) and, therefore, its Page has been updated with the new, updated link</p></li>

<li><p>Replaced all Breadcrumb Trails and their links from <em>Episodes</em> with <em>Videos</em> in all Content Files, since the former served solely for when Episodes and Trivias couldn&rsquo;t be of the same group</p></li>

<li><p>Updated Changelog Page</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the Article about <em>Akkrean</em> which didn&rsquo;t have the Taxonomy Term <code>rarity</code> (English only)</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the video length of Episode #15, Season #01 for the version with Brazilian Portuguese audio which is slightly different of the English one</p></li>

<li><p>Fixed the details of Episode #15, Season #01 for the version with Brazilian Portuguese audio because this version is not in Englis (obviously) but also doesn&rsquo;t have any subtitle as previously described</p></li>

<h4 id="added">Added</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added the HTML entity <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> to all almost all empty tags preventing them to be really empty and therefore considered as removal candidates by HTML Minifiers</p></li>

<li><p>Added a different error message to Card Search, allowing one of the two fatal errors that could yield no results while using the Card Search to be better distinguished</p></li>

<li><p>Added an entry to the <code>.gitignore</code> wrongly removed in previous <em>commits</em></p></li>

<li><p>Added the <code>SiteNavigationElement</code> Structured Data pointing to the Navigation Menu as another SEO improvement</p></li>

<li><p>Added the <em>inLanguage</em> property to the Schema.org <strong>Linked Data</strong> Structured Data</p></li>

<li><p>Added a <code>&lt;wrapper&gt;</code> element to encapsulates the whole content of the site&rsquo;s pages, as part of the fix for the footer covering part of the main content. The technique was borrowed from <a href="https://www.codeply.com/go/tGamlWscIB">this Codeply</a> and, although it works, the presence of the <code>&lt;wrapper&gt;</code> tag in there makes it semantically invalid</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="published-content-related-changes">Published Content related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added appreciation to the VERO Team in the <em>Disclaimer</em> Page</p></li>

</ul>

<h4 id="removed">Removed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-1">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed the i18n entry for the Patron social link. Not only because it&rsquo;s long hidden but also because the new social links markup (see below) doesn&rsquo;t use any text</p></li>

<li><p>Removed some files/folders wrongly added in previous <em>commits</em> by removing them from GIT Cache</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed zoom-level restrictions</p></li>

<li><p>Removed some of Hugo&rsquo;s <code>absURL</code> function usage in favour of Relative URLs</p></li>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-1">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed the top-margin used on Flag Icons because the new Navigation Bar has better alignment thanks to the Flexbox used</p></li>

<ul>

<li><p>Changed the main content wrapper tag from <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;main&gt;</code></p></li>

<li><p>Update the Footer Partial Template with a new and more responsive version in order to remove a mobile-specific alternative version</p></li>

<li><p>Modified the Big Picture markup in order to remove a mobile-specific alternative version</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the Social Links markup with a more simpler one. Although not fancier, that opens/closes on hover, this version doesn&rsquo;t need any hacks to accommodate different lengths of text — i.e. the now hidden Patreon label</p></li>

<li><p>Modified the Cards&rsquo; Images markup for better vertical alignment -AND- to finally remove the long used palliative solution to deal with the &ldquo;white corner fix&rdquo; on Google Chrome</p></li>

<li><p>Updated all Section &amp; Article Titles markup in order to make them more concise -AND- to remove a mobile-specific alternative version</p></li>

<li><p>With the removal of the <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> on the left from the main content, the column width for larger devices (width &gt;= 996px) has been increased</p></li>

<li><p>Applied grammar corrections to the English version of Disclaimer and Terms Pages</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="css-related-changes-2">CSS-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>The new Navigation Menu rendered the <em>Flyout Content</em> — the box that opens on hover — of Languages Menu too small, so top and bottom padding has been added to them</p></li>

<li><p>With the improvements made to the Cards Images&rsquo; vertical alignment the <em>Flavour Texts</em> styles, in the form of Quotes, their inner and sibling components elements (i.e. ToC Tree) had to be adjusted as well because some Articles, about some Cards, have them right below a Card Image — i.e: Najarin</p></li>

<li><p>Adjusted the top-margin of the Loading Icons</p></li>

<li><p>Adjusted margins of Server Selection message and available Providers wrapper container</p></li>

<li><p>All rules needed for the other changes/additions described in this revision have been added, changed or removed</p></li>

<h4 id="added">Added</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Added missing FrontMatter Parameters to describe pictures&rsquo; <em>height</em> and <em>width</em> of most Content Files</p></li>

<li><p>Added the newly implemented attribute <em>picture</em> for the &ldquo;Card&rdquo; Shortcode with the path to the images used. Even though they&rsquo;re the same as the FrontMatter Parameter <em>picture.path</em> this opens the possibility for a future update to expand the currently used &ldquo;Picture&rdquo; Shortcode for Cards&rsquo; variations with the &ldquo;Card&rdquo; Shortcode, providing more information to be parsed by the Card Search</p></li>

<li><p>Added the newly implemented FrontMatter Parameters to disable Facebook Comments Plugin and to prevent Google Analytics to be included in the following Content Files: Category Pages (Attacks, Battlegears, Locations, Mugics and Creatures), Sub-categories Pages (OverWorld, UnderWorld, Mipedians, Danians, M&rsquo;arrillians, Tribeless) and Disclaimer Page</p></li>

<li><p>Added missing  <em>Skin</em> entry under FrontMatter Parameter <em>Trait</em> for Chaor</p></li>

<li><p>Added missing  <em>Hair</em> entry under FrontMatter Parameter <em>Trait</em> for H&rsquo;earring</p></li>

<li><p>Added missing  <em>Skin</em> entry under FrontMatter Parameter <em>Trait</em> for Nauthilax</p></li>

<li><p>Added missing  <em>Hair</em> entry under FrontMatter Parameter <em>Trait</em> for Najarin and the recently discovered Brazilian Portuguese Voice Actor</p></li>

<li><p>Added missing <em>Publishing Date</em> for the following Articles: Malvadine, Blazier, Najarin, Chaor, H&rsquo;earring, Nauthilax, Crystal Cave and UnderWorld City</p></li>

<li><p>Added a new Page for Terms of Use, as a legal counter-part of GDPR</p></li>

<li><p>Published the following Articles: Riverlands, Ulmar, Heptadd</p></li>

<li><p>Partially published (by unmarking as Draft) the following Articles about Hune Canin</p></li>

<li><p>Added the newly renamed FrontMatter Parameter <em>section</em> to all Video Pages</p></li>

<li><p>Added additional URL Parameters to the remaining Vimeo mirrors to clean-up the video player</p></li>

<li><p>Added missing keywords to: Episode #03, Season #01; Episode #27, Season #02</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Implemented the renaming of FrontMatter Parameter <em>section</em> (or <em>type</em>, in case of Articles&rsquo; Pages), <em>picture</em> and <em>languages</em></p></li>

<li><p>Implemented the GDPR-related routine</p></li>

<li><p>Centralized all Partial Templates from the <code>/perim</code> subdirectory in a single one, recently added, Partial Template</p></li>

<li><p>Implemented the new FrontMatter Parameters <em>advertisable</em>, to condition whether or not an Advertisement Code will be added, <em>commentable</em>, for Facebook Comments Plugin and <em>analytics</em> for Google and Facebook Analytics</p></li>

<li><p>Added Partial Templates with the META Tags for Attacks, Battlegears and Mugics</p></li>

<li><p>Added a <code>class</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag used to define foreign languages (i.e. Hindi, Greek&hellip;) so they can be easily styled with CSS, which is important to set them <em>inline</em> to prevent a visual space when they&rsquo;re used along with a comma</p></li>

<h4 id="removed">Removed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-1">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed the FrontMatter Parameter <em>card</em> and <em>subtext</em>, as they&rsquo;re now handled by the <em>picture</em> Parameter and the &ldquo;Quote&rdquo; Shortcode, respectively</p></li>

<li><p>Removed the heading title &ldquo;Abilities&rdquo;, previously added under &ldquo;Game&rdquo;, as it was only cluttering the ToC Tree</p></li>

<li><p>Removed the FrontMatter Parameter <em>languageMirrors</em> as a sub-item of <em>details</em>, after all, it&rsquo;s more related to the Content File which defines the structure rather than the Article/Video Page themselves</p></li>

<li><p>Removed the runtime script from Card Search as a FrontMatter Parameter as this is no longer an option, adding it directly in the script</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-1">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Removed the main Article Name from their variants — e.g. instead of &ldquo;Chaor — The Fierce&rdquo; now only &ldquo;The Fierce&rdquo; is displayed —  cleaning up the ToC Tree</p></li>

<li><p>Removed all Vimeo mirrors of all Episodes dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-1">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>With the changes made to the <em>Flavour Texts</em> in the form of Quotes (see below), the &ldquo;Quote&rdquo; Partial Template became obsolete and, therefore, has been removed</p></li>

<li><p>Removed useless conditionals from &ldquo;Trivia&rdquo; Template as they don&rsquo;t have that many information like regular Episodes</p></li>

<li><p>Removed the Runtime Scripts feature from Footer Partial because while it could look interesting and organized, in fact, hard to maintain and, possibly, a security breach</p></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="changed">Changed</h4>

<h6 id="structure-related-changes-2">Structure-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Changed the FrontMatter Parameter <em>thumbnail</em> to <em>picture</em>, after all, it handles the Big Picture more than the Articles&rsquo; Thumbnails from Listing Pages</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the FrontMatter Parameter <em>group</em> to <em>section</em>, because even though it doesn&rsquo;t affect Hugo&rsquo;s <code>.Section</code> variable it&rsquo;s the most appropriate term to be used</p></li>

<li><p>Renamed the FrontMatter Parameter <em>languageMirrors</em> to <em>languages</em>, which is cleaner and matches its new concept better</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the way the FrontMatter Parameters <em>eyes</em>, <em>hair</em> and <em>skin</em>, all grouped under the <em>traits</em> Parameter, are handled. Now instead of having multiple values manually separated by a slash in a string, they&rsquo;re all an indexed array automatically rendered as a list, like other Parameters that accept multiple values</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the way custom CSS styles are defined for Articles&rsquo; Pictures. Instead of all of them in a single line, like an <em>inline</em> declaration, now they&rsquo;re defined in an associative array of two indices, rule and value. With this change, we can filter out rules that could cause unwanted behaviours, especially on mobile (i.e. <em>height</em> and <em>max-height</em>)</p></li>

<li><p>Reflected the FrontMatter Parameters renaming mentioned above in all Content Files</p></li>

<li><p>Migrated all Images&rsquo; Credits from the <em>Disclaimer</em> Page to each and every Article, Big Pictures and Card Arts</p></li>

<li><p>With the removal of the &ldquo;Abilities&rdquo; heading title mentioned above, all Cards&rsquo; variations are now one level deeper in the ToC Tree hierarchy, falling under &ldquo;Game&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Renamed Content File of <strong>Dranakis Threshold</strong> to match the naming convention of all the others. By all means, this represents a file removal and the inclusion of a new one</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="public-content-related-changes-2">Public Content-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Reviewed all Markdown links to add a slash (/) in the end of each one of them</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the <em>skin</em> entry under the FrontMatter Parameter <em>trait</em> of <strong>Blazier</strong> for Brazilian Portuguese translation, matching the &ldquo;Sunflower Gold&rdquo; of the English version</p></li>

<li><p>Changed the interpretation of the <em>Mugicians</em> expression in all Articles. Now they&rsquo;re described only as &ldquo;Mugicians&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Mugicians&rsquo; Counters&rdquo;, representing them as the actual spirit forms of the Mugic creators of the past, co-existing with the Creatures to power their Mugics</p></li>

<li><p>Typo, grammar and wording corrections and additions for the following Articles: Maxxor, Najarin, Blazier, Heptadd, Takinom, Nauthilax, H&rsquo;earring (Brazilian Portuguese only), Chaor, Malvadine, Glacier Plains, Crystal Cave, Lake Ken-I-Po, Riverlands and UnderWorld City</p></li>

<li><p>Updated <em>Disclaimer</em> Page to thank the team behind Grammarly as well</p></li>

<li><p>Updated FrontMatter Parameters&rsquo; descriptions in the English version of Takinom&rsquo;s Article</p></li>

<li><p>Forced all YouTube mirrors to use the GDPR compliant versions by changing the domain to <code>youtube-nocookie.com</code></p></li>

<li><p>Changed the <em>Date Published</em> of all Episodes dubbed in Brazilian Portuguese</p></li>
</ul>

<h6 id="hugo-templates-related-changes-2">Hugo Templates-related changes</h6>

<ul>
<li><p>Adjusted several of Bootstrap&rsquo;s Grid System Classes and added some more CSS Media Queries to improve the readability and content disposition on mobile devices</p></li>

<li><p>Moved the Google AdSense <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag from the <em>Header</em> Partial Template to one of his own under the <code>/google</code> subdirectory, along with the renamed <code>google.html</code> to <code>analytics.html</code>, which, by all means, this represents a file removal and the inclusion of a new one</p></li>

<li><p>Moved the Facebook SDK and Comments Plugins Partial Templates from the <code>/social</code> subdirectory to the root of Partial Templates named as <code>facebook</code>, following the new naming convention used with the Google Family, which, by all means, this represents a file removal and the inclusion of a new one</p></li>

<li><p>Moved the Social Links Partial Template out of the <code>/social</code> subdirectory to the root of Partial Templates and renaming it to <code>social.html</code>, which, by all means, this represents a file removal and the inclusion of a new one</p></li>

<li><p>Divided one long and hard to read condition for Sidebar Advertisement into two nested conditions</p></li>

<li><p>Expanded the JS/HTML of Partial Templates used, after all, if they&rsquo;ll be compressed again by an HTML Minifier or Cloudflare, let them be readable</p></li>

<li><p>Simplified the &ldquo;Quote&rdquo; Shortcode with a cleaner and less problematic markup that uses Hugo&rsquo;s Shortcode Attributes instead of FrontMatter Parameters, allowing one Shortcode Template to handle all cases of a Quote Text, even though the one added below the Big Picture (if any) now has to be called manually within the Content Files</p></li>

<li><p>Modified the markup of the Big Pictures to reflect the CSS changes made to accommodate the Images&rsquo; Credits</p></li>

<li><p>Replaced the palliative solution for file check with the native <code>fileExists</code> provided by newer versions of Hugo</p></li>

<li><p>Increased the column width of Creatures Biography on mobile devices by reducing the column with the labels a little bit, giving more room for long texts</p></li>

<li><p>Expanded the &ldquo;Picture&rdquo; Shortcode markup to reflect the CSS changes made to accommodate the Images&rsquo; Credits -AND- to improve the visual with now universalized margins</p></li>

<li><p>Adjusted the markup of Episodes/Trivia to reflect the CSS changes made to better accommodate the Breadcrumbs</p></li>

<li><p>Redone the main site footer to better structure legal links, copyright message and &ldquo;powered by&rdquo; links</p></li>

<li><p>Indented pretty much all the Templates used for Episodes/Trivia Single Page</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>Fixed an issue that was preventing <strong>M&rsquo;arrillians</strong> to be used as a Creature filter for Card Search</p></li>
